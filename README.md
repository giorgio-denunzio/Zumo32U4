# Zumo32U4
My (more or less original) software for the Pololu Zumo 32U4 robot.
Work in progress, so don't expect too much. Hints/comments are welcome (giorgio.denunzio AT unisalento.it).

## Files:
- *ObstacleAvoidingZumo32U4.ino*: alpha version of obstacle avoiding. See discussion here https://forum.pololu.com/t/zumo-32u4-troubles-with-obstacle-detection-with-ir-sensors/15474/3 .
- *ReadBatteriesZumo32U4.ino*: very simple battery check (nothing more and something less than the PowerCheck example).
- *TestGyroZumo32U4.ino*: simple gyro test (inspired by MazeSolver). Before compiling, copy TurnSensor.cpp and TurnSensor.h from the following directory: Arduino\libraries\Zumo32U4\examples\MazeSolver.
